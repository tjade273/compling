The use of conditional consistency measures with permutation tests of significance determines how much more regular sound-letter correspondences become when other parts of the syllable are taken into account. A study of English monosyllabic words presents results for both reading (letters to sounds) and spelling (sounds to letters) and both adult and child vocabulary. In all cases, vowel and coda (which constitute the rime) are much more strongly conditioned by each other than are other pairs. These techniques and findings improve our understanding of the English writing system and provide a foundation for a better understanding of reading and spelling processes in children and adults.},

  abstract = {Similar words for similar concepts turn up in many widely scattered languages. Some linguists insist that this is simply due to chance while others claim that many if not all of the world's languages descended from a single prehistoric language. Yet neither position in this strident controversy has been analyzed or supported with statistics. New computerized statistical techniques can help determine whether or not words in different languages have an ancestral connection. These flexible techniques are explained, broken into steps, and illustrated in a manner that provides the necessary principles to linguists with no background in statistics.This methodology measures the probabilistic significance of sound correspondences between short word lists. Many rules of thumb invoked by linguists in order to obviate chance resemblance, such as multilateral comparison and emphasizing grammar over vocabulary, are shown to actually decrease the power of quantitative tests. While the procedures presented here are straightforward, the author also details the extensive linguistic work needed to produce word lists that will not yield nonsensical results. Examples analyze the 200 words in 8 languages that are enumerated and detailed in an appendix.},

  doi = {10.1080/09296170802326681},
  abstract = {Historical relationships among languages are used as a proxy for social history in many non-linguistic settings, including the fields of cultural and molecular anthropology. Linguists have traditionally assembled this information using the standard comparative method. While providing extremely nuanced linguistic information, this approach is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Conversely, computational approaches are appreciably quicker, but can potentially introduce significant error. Furthermore, current methods often use cognate sets that were themselves coded by historical linguists, thus reducing the benefit of computational approaches. Here we develop a method, based on the ALINE distance, to extract feature-sensitive relationships from paired glosses, datasets that require minimal contribution from trained linguists beyond transcription from primary sources. We validate our results by comparison with data generated independently via the comparative method, and quantify error rates using consistency indices. To showcase our method's utility and to demonstrate its robustness at local and regional scales, we apply it to two language datasets from eastern Indonesia. As linguistic datasets proliferate, scalable computational methods that mimic historical linguistic reconstruction will become increasingly necessary. Although at present we cannot disentangle all the processes driving linguistic change (e.g. lexical borrowing), our method provides a robust and accurate alternative to manual linguistic analysis. The feature-sensitive method adopted here accurately and automatically identifies emergent patterns hidden in traditional word-lists by analysing critical phonetic information that is discarded (or required as prerequisite) by many current cognate-based computational methods. This approach is not intended to supplant manual linguistic analysis, but has an important role in quickly generating robust data for non-linguistic fields or interdisciplinary projects that require formal quantitative analysis of historical linguistic relationships. Our approach provides a workable approximate phylogeny in cases where a trained linguist is unavailable, or otherwise significantly reduces the time and effort required for manual classification.},

  doi = {10.1098/rspb.2010.1917},
  abstract = {Language evolution is traditionally described in terms of family trees with ancestral languages splitting into descendent languages. However, it has long been recognized that language evolution also entails horizontal components, most commonly through lexical borrowing. For example, the English language was heavily influenced by Old Norse and Old French; eight per cent of its basic vocabulary is borrowed. Borrowing is a distinctly non-tree-like process\textemdash{}akin to horizontal gene transfer in genome evolution\textemdash{}that cannot be recovered by phylogenetic trees. Here, we infer the frequency of hidden borrowing among 2346 cognates (etymologically related words) of basic vocabulary distributed across 84 Indo-European languages. The dataset includes 124 (5\%) known borrowings. Applying the uniformitarian principle to inventory dynamics in past and present basic vocabularies, we find that 1373 (61\%) of the cognates have been affected by borrowing during their history. Our approach correctly identified 117 (94\%) known borrowings. Reconstructed phylogenetic networks that capture both vertical and horizontal components of evolutionary history reveal that, on average, eight per cent of the words of basic vocabulary in each Indo-European language were involved in borrowing during evolution. Basic vocabulary is often assumed to be relatively resistant to borrowing. Our results indicate that the impact of borrowing is far more widespread than previously thought.},

Applications of the compendium to historical linguistics are proposed. For example, the catalog of correspondences and frequencies facilitates objective assessment of the commonness or rarity of shared phonological innovations cited as evidence for language-family subgrouping. In another analysis, correspondence frequency is used to measure the degree of similarity between different sounds, yielding models for classifying consonants and vowels that substantially agree with articulatory properties. Correspondence-based similarities are also compared with measurements of sound similarity involving factors such as perceptual confusions, speech errors, and cooccurrence patterns in synchronic phonological rules. Sound similarity discerned from both the perception and production of speech is found to correlate to about the same extent with correspondence-based similarities.*},

The pipeline consists of suitably modified algorithms based on recent research in bioinformatics, which are adapted to the specifics of linguistic data. This approach can alleviate much of the laborious research needed to establish proof of historical relationships between languages. Equally important to our proposal is that each step in the workflow of the comparative method is implemented independently, so language specialists have the possibility to scrutinize intermediate results. We have used our pipeline to investigate two groups of languages, the Tsezic languages of the Caucasus and the Mataco-Guaicuruan languages of South America, based on the lexical data from the \emph{Intercontinental Dictionary Series (IDS)}. The results of these tests show that the current approach is a viable and useful extension to historical linguistic research.},

In this way, computational approaches can take care of the repetitive and schematic tasks leaving experts to concentrate on answering interesting questions. Here we test the potential of automatic methods to detect etymologically related words (cognates) in cross-linguistic data. Using a newly compiled database of expert cognate judgments across five different language families, we compare how well different automatic approaches distinguish related from unrelated words. Our results show that automatic methods can identify cognates with a very high degree of accuracy, reaching 89\% for the best-performing method Infomap. We identify the specific strengths and weaknesses of these different methods and point to major challenges for future approaches.

The sequences are assumed a priori to share a common ancestor, and the trees are constructed from difference matrices derived directly from the multiple alignment. The thrust of the method involves putting more trust in the comparison of recently diverged sequences than in those evolved in the distant past. In particular, this rule is followed: "once a gap, always a gap." The method has been applied to three sets of protein sequences: 7 superoxide dismutases, 11 globins, and 9 tyrosine kinase-like sequences. Multiple alignments and phylogenetic trees for these sets of sequences were determined and compared with trees derived by conventional pairwise treatments. In several instances, the progressive method led to trees that appeared to be more in line with biological expectations than were trees obtained by more commonly used methods.},

Accordingly, quantification of the variation in PID caused by the different calculations would help in interpreting PID values in the literature. In this study, the variation in PID was quantified systematically on a reference set of 1028 alignments generated by comparison of the protein three-dimensional structures. Since the alignment algorithm may also affect the range of PID, this study also considered the effect of algorithm, and the combination of algorithm and PID method.
RESULTS: The maximum variation in PID due to the calculation method was 11.5\% while the effect of alignment algorithm on PID was up to 14.6\% across three popular alignment methods. The combined effect of alignment algorithm and PID calculation gave a variation of up to 22\% on the test data, with an average of 5.3\% +/- 2.8\% for sequence pairs with $<$ 30\% identity. In order to see which PID method was most highly correlated with structural similarity, four different PID calculations were compared to similarity scores (Sc) from the comparison of the corresponding protein three-dimensional structures. The highest correlation coefficient for a PID calculation was 0.80. In contrast, the more sophisticated Z-score calculated by reference to randomized sequences gave a correlation coefficient of 0.84.
CONCLUSION: Although it is well known amongst expert sequence analysts that PID is a poor score for discriminating between protein sequences, the apparent simplicity of the percentage identity score encourages its widespread use in establishing cutoffs for structural similarity. This paper illustrates that not only is PID a poor measure of sequence similarity when compared to the Z-score, but that there is also a large uncertainty in reported PID values. Since better alternatives to PID exist to quantify sequence similarity, these should be quoted where possible in preference to PID. The findings presented here should prove helpful to those new to sequence analysis, and in warning those who seek to interpret the value of a PID reported in the literature.},

  abstract = {In this paper I present the most recent version of the SCA method for pairwise and multiple alignment analyses. In contrast to previously proposed alignment methods, SCA is based on a novel framework of sequence alignment which combines new approaches to sequence modeling in historical linguistics with recent developments in computational biology. In contrast to earlier versions of SCA [1,2] the new version comes along with a couple of modifications that significantly improve the performance and the application range of the algorithm: A new sound class model was defined which works well on highly divergent sequences, the algorithm for pairwise alignment was modified to be sensitive to secondary sequence structures such as syllable boundaries, and an algorithm for the pre-processing of the data in multiple alignment analyses [3] was included to cope for the bias resulting from progressive alignment analyses. In order to test the method, a new gold standard for pairwise and multiple alignment analyses was created which consists of 45 947 sequences covering a total of 435 different taxa belonging to six different language families.},

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with algorithms for prediction of discrete sequences over a finite alphabet, using variable order Markov models. The class of such algorithms is large and in principle includes any lossless compression algorithm. We focus on six prominent prediction algorithms, including Context Tree Weighting (CTW), Prediction by Partial Match (PPM) and Probabilistic Suffix Trees (PSTs). We discuss the properties of these algorithms and compare their performance using real life sequences from three domains: proteins, English text and music pieces. The comparison is made with respect to prediction quality as measured by the average log-loss. We also compare classification algorithms based on these predictors with respect to a number of large protein classification tasks. Our results indicate that a "decomposed" CTW (a variant of the CTW algorithm) and PPM outperform all other algorithms in sequence prediction tasks. Somewhat surprisingly, a different algorithm, which is a modification of the Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm, significantly outperforms all algorithms on the protein classification problems.},
